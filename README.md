## Instructions ðŸ•¶

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above  
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)  
- MySQL database with a schema named `student_management_system`  

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shivammiyyy/Student_Management_System
   ```

2. **Setup MySQL database**  
   - Create a MySQL database named `student_management_system`.  
   - Update the database connection properties in the backend Spring Boot `application.properties` file:
     ```
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_management_system
     spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
     ```

3. **Build and run the Spring Boot backend**  
   - Navigate to the backend directory (e.g., `springboot-backend`):  
     ```
     cd springboot-backend
     ```
   - Build the project using Maven (Linux/macOS):  
     ```
     ./mvnw clean package
     ```  
     *or on Windows:*  
     ```
     mvnw.cmd clean package
     ```
   - Run the backend server:  
     ```
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

4. **Install dependencies and run the React frontend**  
   - Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory (`react-frontend`):  
     ```
     cd react-frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:  
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:  
     ```
     npm start
     ```

5. **Access the application**  
   - Backend runs on default port `8080`.  
   - Frontend runs by default on port `3000` (or `5137` if customized).  
   - Open your web browser and go to:  
     http://localhost:5137
     

---

## Notes

- Ensure backend is running before interacting with the frontend to avoid API call failures.  
- The system uses REST APIs exposed by the Spring Boot backend for all student and department management.  
- Toast notifications pop up on frontend after create, update, delete actions to confirm success or show error messages.
